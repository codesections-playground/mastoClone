//Build a backend server that returns data (REST API) using Node.JS/Express

/*
Here in App.js we'd handle our routes, this will also act as our controllers (coming from the navBar on the client-side)
Setup a basic server
A database, MariaDB
Middleware
Models

We're in a LEAN-style methodology.
Build client first (Build only one component from navBar at one time)
Build server w/o database first

Build another navBar component
Build server w/ database and connect the 2+
Authentication
